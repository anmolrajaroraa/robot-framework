Robot is an test automation framework

What is automation testing?
It is done using some automated tool that executes scripts and generates automatically for us

What is a framework?

What is test automation framework?

Types of automation testing:-
1. Linear  (record and playback testing)
You just have to write steps in sequential order

Advantages:-
There is no need to write custom code
fastest way to generate test scripts
workflow is easy to understand
Disadvantages:-
Scripts that we create are not reusable
Maintenance is hassle at times of changes in application


2. Modular Based
testers break application under test into functions or sections and then create individual scripts for each section and then these scripts make for a bigger script

Advantages:-
If there is a chnage you have to just change the script of a particular section
Scripts can be reused and hence easy to generate test cases
Disadvantages:-
Data is hard coded so script might not be reused
Programming language is little bit needed 

3. Library Architecture Testing

4. Data driven testing

5. Keyword-driven testing

6. Hybrid testing
