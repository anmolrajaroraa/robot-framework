2. pip install robotframework==3.0.2



Robot is an test automation framework

What is automation testing?
It is done using some automated tool that executes scripts and generates automatically for us

What is a framework?
Framework has some set of rules or best practices to achieve the desired result

What is test automation framework?

Types of automation testing:-
1. Linear  (record and playback testing)
You just have to write steps in sequential order

Advantages:-
There is no need to write custom code
fastest way to generate test scripts
workflow is easy to understand
Disadvantages:-
Scripts that we create are not reusable
Maintenance is hassle at times of changes in application


2. Modular Based
testers break application under test into functions or sections and then create individual scripts for each section and then these scripts make for a bigger script

Advantages:-
If there is a chnage you have to just change the script of a particular section
Scripts can be reused and hence easy to generate test cases
Disadvantages:-
Data is hard coded so script might not be reused
Programming language is little bit needed 

3. Library Architecture Testing

Advantages:-
Higher degree of reusability
Scalability
Disadvantages:-
Data is hard coded
Technical expertise is needed 

4. Data driven testing

Advantage:-
Tests can be executed with multiple data sets
Hard coding is avoided
Multiple scenarios can be tested
Disadvantage:-
knowledge regarding DB is needed
Takes a lot of time to be set up

5. Keyword-driven testing

Advantages:-
No scripting knowledge is needed
Single keyword can be used multiple times
Disadvantages:-
Keywords management 

6. Hybrid testing


What is robot framework
Test automation framework developed for acceptance testing

Robot framework vs Selenium webdriver

Robot features :-
1. High level architecture
2. Simple tabular syntax
3. Data driven test cases
4. Clear reports
5. Detailed logs
6. Generic Libraries
7. Separate data editor
8. Test case tagging
9. Colour coding

Variables
It stores our values
77B  -> A = 10

Types of variables:- 
1. Scalar
${username}    ($->S->Scalar)

2. List
numbers = [10,20,30,40,50]
numbers[0] -> 10
numbers[4] -> 50
credentials = [admin, 1234]
@{credentials[0]}    (@->A->Array)
@{credentials[1]}

3. Dictionary

oxford = {	ephemeral = not having long life, durable = having long life  }
credentials = { username = admin, password = 1234 }
&{credentials}[username]
&{credentials}[password]


4. Environmental variables
%{username}, os

5. Built-in variables
${test_case}
